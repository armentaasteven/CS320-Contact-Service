# CS320-Contact-Service

Overview
This repository contains my work from two projects that demonstrate my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The files include unit tests and reports that show how I ensure software functionality and security.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
To make sure my code is both functional and secure, I used unit testing to catch errors and confirm that features worked as expected. I also followed secure coding practices, such as input validation and error handling, to prevent vulnerabilities.

Understanding and Incorporating User Needs
I interpreted user needs by analyzing project requirements and making sure the software met those expectations. Through testing, I checked that the program functioned correctly in different scenarios, ensuring a good user experience.

Software Design Approach
When designing software, I focused on clarity, modularity, and maintainability. Breaking the project into smaller components, like separate classes for contact management, made it easier to test and update. I also applied test-driven development (TDD) principles to write tests early and guide my coding process.
